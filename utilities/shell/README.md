# Twitch shell utilities

- Simple shell utilities, needed one time or another during testing and development.
- Not all steps are automated — some require very manual copy-paste.
- See the main readme file for setting up Twitch application environment variables.
- See individual files for documentation, but don't expect too much.
- A part of [botten-nappet](https://joelpurra.com/projects/botten-nappet/).
